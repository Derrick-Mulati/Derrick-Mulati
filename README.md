## 📈 Model Training Metrics

```python
import torch

class Engineer(Human):
    def daily_routine(self):
        while True:
            data = gather_insights()
            model = build_architecture()
            
            loss = model.train(data)
            
            if loss < 0.01:
                deploy_to_prod()
                break
            else:
                optimize_hyperparameters()
